# Mine Sweeper

## Purpose

I wanted to practice my front-end web development skills in a fun way by creating a game. I used to really love playing Minesweeper on my old Windows machines.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technologies used

Next.js 13 with the new app directory was used as the backbone for this project.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling of this project.

This project was coded using TypeScript.
